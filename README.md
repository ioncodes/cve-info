# cve-info
Parses CVE IDs and returns information about the vulnerability.

## Why?
[@mkolsek](https://twitter.com/mkolsek/status/1382327455961264135) had the idea to create a browser extension that finds all CVE IDs in a webpage and then highlights them providing both a hyperlink and a popup dialog on hover that shows basic information about the vulnerability. This project contains the logic part to make it easier to port the plugins to different browsers.

## Features
[x] MITRE
